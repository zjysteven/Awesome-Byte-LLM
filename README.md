# Awesome Byte-Based Large Language Models

## Introduction

Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying byte-based large language models (LLMs). These models eliminate the need for tokenization and operate directly on raw bytesâ€”the universal format of the digital world. Byte-based models offer several promising advantages, including:

- **Enhanced robustness and generalization:** By removing the heuristic biases introduced by tokenization, these models could achieve better adaptability.
- **Cross-modality scalability:** Since all data can be represented as bytes, these models naturally extend to multiple modalities.

This repository serves as an ongoing collection of papers and resources focused on byte-based LLMs.

## Papers

The meaning of most fields are clear by their names. "Date" is the time that the work is released/made public (e.g., the timestamp of its first arXiv version). "Summary" is a one-sentence summary of the paper.

| Title | Date | Conference | Code | Summary |
|-------|:----:|:----------:|:----:|---------|
| [MEGABYTE: Predicting Million-byte Sequences with Multiscale Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07185) | 2023-05 | NeurIPS'23 | - | <details>The paper introduces MEGABYTE, a multiscale Transformer architecture that segments sequences into patches, enabling efficient modeling of million-byte sequences with sub-quadratic self-attention, enhanced feedforward computation, and improved decoding parallelism, achieving competitive performance on tasks like long-context language modeling, image generation, and audio modeling.</details> |
